Your pain has been heard and scattered into starlight.
The void accepts your words without judgment.
Your message has been absorbed into the static between galaxies.
A moonbeam tucked it away gently for safekeeping.
The wind whispered your thoughts to a listening sky.
It now floats like a paper lantern on a quiet sea.
Your truth was captured in a dream and will echo kindly.
It now drifts softly through the fogâ€”unburdened, but not forgotten.
The universe filed it between the heartbeat of stars.
It was gently folded into the pages of a forgotten spellbook.
The night heard you and dimmed the stars to listen closer.
Your voice became the hum inside an old radio tuned to empathy.
A crow flew off with your words stitched into its wings.
It joined the chorus of sighs in the deep forest where no one is alone.
A constellation rearranged itself to make room for your grief.
It echoed once across a haunted meadow and then rested.
Your sorrow curled up beside a firefly and blinked softly into the dark.
A raccoon with glitter tears is holding space for you now.
The static has received your signal and sends warmth in return.
Your story has been wrapped in moss and laid gently at the base of an old tree.
A candle in the void flickered just for you.
An invisible witch added it to her cauldron of secret griefs.
A mirror in a dream caught your reflection and held it tenderly.
Your words have been turned into starsong and scattered gently above.
